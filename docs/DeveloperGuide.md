### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.

- At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following five components:

- [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
- [**`Security`**](#security-component): Validates password presence and handles initial configuration.
- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor and handler for App Mode.
- [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user completes the initial password setup (e.g., submitting `"myPassword123"`).

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="900" />

Each of the five main components (also shown in the diagram above),

- defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
- implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `CommandHistory`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

- executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
- listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
- keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Security component

**API** : [`Security.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/security/Security.java)

Here's a class diagram of the `Security` component:

<puml src="diagrams/SecurityClassDiagram.puml" width="300"/>

The `Security` component is responsible for the application's integrity check upon startup and handling password authentication state.

- **Integrity Check:** Verifies if the `password` field in the storage file is present and contains valid characters via `isAuthenticated()`.
- **Startup Logic:** Returns a boolean value indicating whether the application should transition to the initial Setup Panel.
- **Password Setup:** Validates the user's plain-text input using `PasswordUtil` and delegates to the `Logic` component to securely save the password state.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions during the startup phase, showing how the `Security` component determines the initial UI state.

<puml src="diagrams/SecurityStartupSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions during the startup integrity check" />

How the startup check works:
1. `MainWindow` asks `Security` if the app is configured via `isAuthenticated()` during its initialization phase (`fillInnerParts()`).
2. `Security` queries `Logic` (which in turn queries `Model`) for the stored password state.
3. Based on the result (valid password vs. empty/missing), `Security` returns a boolean back to `MainWindow`.
4. If the application is not authenticated, `MainWindow` then invokes `handleSetup()` to load the new `SetupPanel` for the user.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

#### Unlock Command Example

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for a state-changing command, taking `execute("unlock myPassword123")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/UnlockSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `unlock` Command" />

This diagram shows how the `UnlockCommand` validates a password against the stored credentials in the `Model` and transitions the application to the `UNLOCKED` state upon successful authentication.

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command communicates with the **`Model`** when it is executed (e.g., to delete a person).
    * **App Mode Management:** `Logic` is also responsible for managing state transitions; it passes the current `AppMode` (Locked or Unlocked) down to the `Model` for execution.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

- When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
- All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

- stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
- stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
- stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
- does not depend on any of the other four components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

- can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
- inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Setup Password Implementation

The current setup feature allows users to configure a secure password for their vault. Setting up a valid password is mandatory to ensure the privacy of the Unlocked mode. The setup mechanism switches the user interface to a dedicated view via `SetupPanel`.

The setup initialization is facilitated by `MainWindow`, `SecurityManager`, and `LogicManager`. It securely delegates the
exact UI state change back to the UI context.

When an operation dictates that the user is required to set a password, the system invokes the `MainWindow#handleSetup()` mechanism. This occurs in two primary ways:

1.  **Initial Launch** — `MainWindow#fillInnerParts()` checks upon startup via `SecurityManager#isAuthenticated()`. If no valid password exists in the save file (such as on the first launch/data corruption), it prevents normal rendering of `MainWindow`.
2.  **Setup Command** — While in Unlocked mode, the user deliberately enters the `setup` command.

When the `setup` command is executed, `LogicManager` generates an empty `SetupCommand`. It creates and returns a `CommandResult` object with its `showSetup` flag evaluated to `true`. When the `CommandResult` is returned to the `MainWindow`, it checks `isShowSetup() == true`, and switches the active GUI root to the `SetupPanel`.

Once the user is on the `SetupPanel`, they submit a string password, and the UI triggers the `MainWindow#handlePasswordInput(String)` callback. `SecurityManager` intercepts this, validates it utilizing `PasswordUtil`, and communicates with `LogicManager` to store it via `LogicManager#setAddressBookPassword()` and writes it persistently via `LogicManager#saveAddressBook()`.

The following operations actively facilitate password setup and its view transitions:

*   `SecurityManager#isAuthenticated()` — Validates whether a setup screen should appear.
*   `CommandResult#isShowSetup()` — Checks if a command actively dictates a transition to the configuration interface.
*   `MainWindow#handleSetup()` — Triggers the application into rendering its custom `SetupPanel` view.
*   `SecurityManager#savePassword(String)` — Validates the password and store it persistently in `Storage`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the system behaves at each step when initiated via command.

**Step 1.** The user launches the application, successfully enters the Unlocked Mode, and types `setup`.

**Step 2.** The `LogicManager` propagates execution. Since the command identifies correctly, the parser creates a `SetupCommand`.

**Step 3.** The `SetupCommand` executes. It creates a `CommandResult` instantiated with a `showSetup` flag set to `true`.

**Step 4.** The `MainWindow` retrieves the boolean via `CommandResult#isShowSetup()`. Recognizing it is `true`, it immediately calls `MainWindow#handleSetup()`, which renders the secondary `SetupPanel` directly onto the primary stage.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the user fails to input a valid secure string inside the `SetupPanel`, `SecurityManager` throws an exception that `MainWindow` catches, ensuring the user stays restricted inside the `SetupPanel` until a valid one is stored.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an explicit `setup` execution passes through the UI and Logic component:

<puml src="diagrams/SetupSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Setup Sequence Diagram" />

**Design considerations:**

**Aspect: How a password entry executes:**

*   **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Switches to a dedicated `SetupPanel` view.
    *   **Pros:** Prominently guides the user through the password setup and ensures the user is not able to interact
    with the application without going through the critical setup phase.
    *   **Cons:** Architecture becomes slightly more complex, as the state transition requires propagating an abstract representation of UI intent (`showSetup=true` flags inside `CommandResult`) directly back to the active `MainWindow`.

*   **Alternative 2:** Execute it purely as a one-liner console command like `setup mypassword123`.
    *   **Pros:** Requires almost no architectural additions inside `UI`, very simple implementation, avoids an entire UI panel creation sequence.
    *   **Cons:** Harder to implement mode-based command restrictions as the initial setup will need be executed in Locked mode but password changes should only be done in the Unlocked mode. Furthermore, the setup command could be saved in the `CommandHistory`, potentially revealing the existence of hidden functionalities in Locked mode.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

- is a social individual in a high-scrutiny domestic environment
- has their digital privacy frequently compromised by an overbearing or possessive partner
- needs to discreetly manage sensitive social connections
- requires a fast interface for the near-instant concealment of private data during unexpected screen checks
- can type incredibly fast and prefers typing to mouse interactions

**Value proposition**: Spyglass provides a secure interface for managing sensitive contacts hidden from observers. It allows users to categorise private contacts, enabling the concealment of private data through commands that hides sensitive entries. This ensures the application maintains the appearance of a standard address book, providing a layer of plausible deniability.

## User Stories

**Priorities:** High (must have) - `* * *`, Medium (nice to have) - `* *`, Low (unlikely to have) - `*`

| Priority | As a …​ | I want to …​ | So that I can…​                                                  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |:-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `* * *` | Contact Manager | add a contact with essential details | store new social connections efficiently.                        |
| `* * *` | Contact Manager | view a list of public contacts | see my everyday connections at a glance.                         |
| `* * *` | Discreet Contact Manager | delete sensitive contacts while in Unlocked mode | remove specific records permanently to avoid detection.          |
| `* * *` | Discreet Contact Manager | switch to Locked mode instantly | hide private data and display a harmless interface to onlookers. |
| `* * *` | Privacy-Conscious User | set a secure password upon initial launch | ensure only I can access the locked mode of the app.             |
| `* * *` | Privacy-Conscious User | unlock the app using a secret password | transition from the public view to my private contact list.      |
| `* *` | Contact Manager | edit contact information | keep my records accurate and up to date.                         |
| `* *` | Discreet Contact Manager | search through hidden contacts by keyword | quickly retrieve sensitive information without manual scrolling. |
