### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.

- At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

- [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
- [**`Security`**](#security-component): Validates password presence and handles initial configuration.
- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor and handler for App Mode.
- [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

- defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
- implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `CommandHistory`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

- executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
- listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
- keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Security component

**API** : [`Security.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/security/Security.java)

The `Security` component is responsible for the application's integrity check upon startup.

- **Integrity Check:** Verifies if the `password` field in the storage file is present and contains valid characters (not just empty or whitespace).
- **Startup Logic:** Returns a status to `Main` indicating whether the application should proceed to the Password Setup screen or the standard Locked Mode.
- **Note:** It does *not* handle runtime password verification for restricted commands; that is delegated to the `Logic` and `Model` components.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions during the startup phase, showing how the `Security` component determines the initial UI state.

<puml src="diagrams/SecurityStartupSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions during the startup integrity check" />

How the startup check works:
1. `MainApp` calls `Security#getStartupStatus()`.
2. `Security` queries `Storage` for the current password configuration.
3. Based on the result (valid password vs. empty/missing), `Security` returns a status code.
4. `MainApp` then initializes either the `MainWindow` or the `PasswordSetupWindow` based on that status.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

The `Logic` component is responsible for:

- receiving raw command text from the UI
- parsing that text into concrete `Command` objects
- enforcing mode-based command availability via `CommandRegistry`
- executing commands against the current `Model` using a `CommandContext`
- applying requested mode transitions through `AppModeManager`
- saving the address book through `Storage` after each command that completes without throwing
- returning a `CommandResult` to the UI so that the UI can handle follow-up actions such as
  selecting a person, showing setup, or exiting the application

Here is a partial class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="650"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for
`execute("delete 1")`, assuming the provided index is valid.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions inside the Logic component for the delete command" />

#### Unlock command example

The next sequence diagram shows how a mode-changing command flows through the same pipeline, using
`execute("unlock myPassword123")` as the example and assuming the application is currently in
locked mode.

<puml src="diagrams/UnlockSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions inside the Logic component for the unlock command" />

This diagram highlights an important design decision: `UnlockCommand` does not directly mutate the
application mode. Instead, it validates the password and returns a `CommandResult` that requests
`AppMode.UNLOCKED`. `LogicManager` is responsible for applying the transition through
`AppModeManager`, refreshing the filtered list for the new mode, and persisting the address book.

How the `Logic` component works:

1. `LogicManager#execute(...)` receives the raw command text from the UI and logs it.
1. `LogicManager` forwards the raw text to `AddressBookParser`.
1. `AddressBookParser` trims the input, splits it into `commandWord` and `arguments` using
   `BASIC_COMMAND_FORMAT`, then queries the current `AppMode` through the `Supplier<AppMode>`
   provided by `LogicManager`.
1. `AddressBookParser` delegates mode-aware command routing to `CommandRegistry`.
1. `CommandRegistry` checks whether the command is registered and allowed in the current mode.
   If either check fails, it throws a generic unknown-command `ParseException`.
1. If the command requires structured argument parsing, `CommandRegistry` delegates to a concrete
   parser such as `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, `EditCommandParser`,
   `FindCommandParser`, `HelpCommandParser`, `ToggleCommandParser`, `UnlockCommandParser`,
   or `ViewCommandParser`.
1. Commands that do not require their own parser, such as `clear`, `list`, `lock`, `exit`,
   and `setup`, are instantiated directly by `CommandRegistry`.
1. After parsing, `LogicManager` creates a `CommandContext`, which packages the current `Model`
   and `AppMode` at execution time.
1. The parsed command executes using that `CommandContext`.
   This avoids stale-state issues where a command could be parsed under one mode but executed
   after the application has already transitioned to another.
1. The command returns a `CommandResult`.
   In addition to user-facing feedback, `CommandResult` can request follow-up UI actions such as
   selecting a person by index, opening the setup flow, exiting the application, or transitioning
   to a different `AppMode`.
1. If `CommandResult` requests a mode change, `LogicManager` updates `AppModeManager`
   and refreshes the filtered list in `Model` for the requested mode.
1. `LogicManager` saves the current address book through `Storage`.
   If saving fails, `AccessDeniedException` and `IOException` are wrapped and surfaced as
   `CommandException`.

Concrete command classes encapsulate feature-specific behaviour after parsing. For example,
`AddCommand`, `DeleteCommand`, `ToggleCommand`, and `ViewCommand` obtain the current `Model`
and `AppMode` from `CommandContext` before mutating or querying the filtered list.
Commands then use `CommandResult` to communicate follow-up actions:
`AddCommand`, `EditCommand`, and `ViewCommand` can request UI selection through `selectedIndex`,
`SetupCommand` uses `showSetup`, `ExitCommand` uses `exit`, and `LockCommand` /
`UnlockCommand` request mode changes through `requestedMode`.

The parser-related classes used by the `Logic` component are shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="700"/>

How the parsing support classes work:

- All concrete parsers implement the `Parser<T>` interface.
- `AddressBookParser` is intentionally lightweight: it only performs the initial split of raw user
  input before handing mode-aware routing to `CommandRegistry`.
- `CommandRegistry` centralizes command registration and authorization, which keeps parser selection
  logic and mode rules out of `AddressBookParser`.
- `ArgumentTokenizer`, `ArgumentMultimap`, `ParserUtil`, `CliSyntax`, and `Prefix` are reused by
  parsers that need structured argument extraction and validation.

### Model component

The `Model` component,

- stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
- stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
- stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
- does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

- can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects. 
- saves the application's **access password** alongside the contact list within `JsonSerializableAddressBook` to ensure the security state persists across application launches. 
- preserves the privacy status of each `Person` status (Public or Sensitive) during serialisation, enabling the Model to correctly filter the FilteredPersonList based on the active AppMode.
- inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, allowing it to be treated as either interface depending on the required functionality.

The `Storage` component depends on the following classes in the `Model` component:

- **`ReadOnlyAddressBook` & `ReadOnlyUserPrefs`**: Used to retrieve immutable snapshots of the data for the saving process.
- **`Person`**: Required by `JsonAdaptedPerson` to map contact details and privacy levels from JSON format to domain objects.
- **`UserPrefs`**: Used to store and retrieve metadata such as GUI settings and the path to the data file.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how selected features are implemented.

### Lock/Unlock mode switching

This subsection describes how SpyGlass switches between **Locked** and **Unlocked** mode.
It focuses on mode transitions and UI behaviour only.
Password setup and password persistence are documented separately.

#### Implementation

The lock/unlock mechanism is facilitated primarily by `AppModeManager`, `CommandResult`,
`LogicManager`, `ModelManager`, and `MainWindow`.

Unlike an implementation that swaps between two separate databases, SpyGlass keeps a single
combined `AddressBook` in memory and exposes different views of that data depending on the
current `AppMode`.

The relevant responsibilities are:

- `LockCommand#execute(CommandContext)` returns a `CommandResult` requesting `AppMode.LOCKED`.
- `UnlockCommand#execute(CommandContext)` validates the password against `Model` and returns a
  `CommandResult` requesting `AppMode.UNLOCKED` when validation succeeds.
- `LogicManager#execute(String)` applies the requested mode change through `AppModeManager`,
  refreshes the filtered list for the new mode, and persists the address book through `Storage`.
- `ModelManager#getFilteredPersonList(AppMode)` and
  `ModelManager#updateFilteredPersonList(Predicate<Person>, AppMode)` expose the correct mode-based
  view of the same underlying address book.
- `MainWindow#updateUi(AppMode)` refreshes the visible UI after a mode change by updating the
  application title, refreshing the person list, clearing the selected person details, and toggling
  restricted fields such as the status label in the detail panel.

The following state diagram summarizes the two application modes and their visible behaviour:

<puml src="diagrams/LockUnlockStateDiagram.puml" width="650" />

A few implementation details are worth noting:

- The current mode is stored centrally in `AppModeManager`, not inside individual commands.
- `LockCommand` and `UnlockCommand` do not directly mutate global application state.
  They only return a `CommandResult` that requests a mode transition.
- `LogicManager` is responsible for applying the mode transition and refreshing the filtered list.
- `ModelManager` maintains two filtered views over the same combined person list:
  one for locked mode and one for unlocked mode.
- In locked mode, only persons with `PersonStatus.LOCKED` are visible.
  In unlocked mode, the filtered list can show the full combined list.
- A successful mode switch is still followed by `Storage#saveAddressBook(...)`,
  because `LogicManager` persists the address book after every command that completes without
  throwing an exception.

#### Lock flow

`lock` is registered only for **Unlocked** mode in `CommandRegistry`.
When the user executes `lock`, the command does not directly update `AppModeManager`.
Instead, it returns a `CommandResult` requesting `AppMode.LOCKED`.

`LogicManager` then:

1. applies the requested mode transition through `AppModeManager`
1. refreshes the model using `Model.PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS` for locked mode
1. saves the address book through `Storage`

After that, `MainWindow` updates the visible interface by:

- changing the window title from `Spyglass` to `AddressBook`
- refreshing the person list so only locked contacts remain visible
- clearing the currently selected person details
- hiding restricted UI fields such as the status label in the detail panel

The sequence diagram below shows the successful `lock` path:

<puml src="diagrams/LockSequenceDiagram.puml" width="900" />

One intentional UI decision is that lock success feedback is not shown in the result pane.
`MainWindow` clears the previous result history during a mode change, and only restores feedback
for unlock transitions.
This makes the locked interface appear cleaner and less suspicious.

#### Unlock flow

`unlock` is registered in both modes, but it behaves differently depending on the current state.

When the app is in locked mode, `UnlockCommand` validates the provided password against the value
stored in `Model`. If the password is correct, it returns a `CommandResult` requesting
`AppMode.UNLOCKED`.

`LogicManager` then:

1. applies the requested mode transition through `AppModeManager`
1. refreshes the filtered list for unlocked mode
1. saves the address book through `Storage`

Finally, `MainWindow` updates the UI by:

- changing the window title from `AddressBook` to `Spyglass`
- refreshing the person list so the unlocked-mode view is shown
- clearing the current person details and updating the detail panel for the new mode
- showing the unlock success message in the result pane

If the provided password is incorrect while the app is locked, `UnlockCommand` throws a generic
unknown-command `CommandException` instead of revealing password failure explicitly.
If `unlock` is executed while the app is already unlocked, it throws a specific
"already unlocked" message instead.

The sequence diagram below shows the successful unlock path and the incorrect-password path:

<puml src="diagrams/UnlockSequenceDiagram.puml" width="900" />

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: Where mode transitions should be applied**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Commands return a `CommandResult` that requests a mode change,
  and `LogicManager` applies the transition.
  - Pros: Keeps commands simple and avoids coupling them directly to global application state.
  - Pros: Ensures all mode-changing commands follow the same post-processing pipeline
    (mode update, filtered-list refresh, and save).
  - Cons: The full behaviour of `lock`/`unlock` is split across command, logic, model, and UI.

- **Alternative 2:** Let `LockCommand` and `UnlockCommand` directly mutate the current mode.
  - Pros: Reduces the amount of follow-up handling outside the command class.
  - Cons: Increases coupling between commands and application state managers.
  - Cons: Makes it easier for commands to bypass consistent refresh and persistence behaviour.

**Aspect: How locked and unlocked contact views should be represented**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Maintain one combined address book and expose different
  filtered views depending on `AppMode`.
  - Pros: Provides a single source of truth for all contacts.
  - Pros: Simplifies features that operate across both modes, such as toggling a contact's status.
  - Pros: Avoids data duplication and synchronization problems between separate lists.
  - Cons: Mode behaviour depends on correct filtering logic in `ModelManager`.

- **Alternative 2:** Maintain separate data stores or separate in-memory lists for locked and
  unlocked contacts.
  - Pros: Makes the distinction between the two modes conceptually explicit.
  - Cons: Introduces extra synchronization complexity when contacts move between modes.
  - Cons: Makes shared operations and persistence logic harder to maintain.

### Glossary

- **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS.
- **Privacy-conscious user**: An individual who maintains a distinction between sensitive and public contacts, requiring distinct access protocols and visibility levels for each to ensure personal privacy.
- **User under scrutiny**: A user in a high-pressure environment where their digital privacy is actively monitored or at risk of compromise.
- **Locked Mode**: The default, public state of the application. It functions as a standard, mundane address book to provide plausible deniability and hide the existence of any sensitive data from onlookers.
  - *Visual Identifier:* The window title displays as **"AddressBook"** to blend in with standard utility software.
- **Unlocked Mode**: The secure state of the application, revealed only after entering a hidden password. This mode allows the user to view, add and manage sensitive contacts that are otherwise hidden.
  - *Visual Identifier:* The window title displays as **"Spyglass"** to confirm the user has access to private data.
- **Sensitive Contact**: A contact entry that is only visible and accessible while the application is in Unlocked Mode.
- **Public Contact**: A contact entry that remains visible in both Locked and Unlocked modes.
- **Restricted Command**: A command that is only operational in a specific mode. For example, the `setup` command only functions when the application is currently Unlocked.
- **Unrestricted Command**: A command that functions consistently across both Locked and Unlocked modes, such as the `exit` or `list` commands.
- **Highlighted Contact**: The specific contact entry currently selected from the list, whose full details are displayed in the UI component located at the bottom left of the interface.
- **MSS (Main Success Scenario)**: The most straightforward interaction for a given use case that assumes nothing goes wrong and all steps are completed successfully.
- **API (Application Programming Interface)**: A set of rules or protocols that govern the application to allow different software components or external applications to communicate and work together.
- **CLI (Command Line Interface)**: A text-based interface where users interact with Spyglass by typing specific commands on a keyboard.
- **GUI (Graphical User Interface)**: The visual component of the application that displays contact lists and command results, allowing users to see information processed via the CLI.
- **JAR**: A Java Archive file format used to distribute the Spyglass application and its required libraries as a single, portable executable file.
- **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**: A lightweight, human-readable data format used by Spyglass to store contact information, password and application settings in local storage.

### Launch and Password Setup

1. **Initial launch and setup**
    1. Download the `spyglass.jar` file and copy it into an empty folder.
