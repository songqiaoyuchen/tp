### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the **app launch** and **shut down**.

- At app launch, it **initializes** the other components in the correct sequence, and **connects** them up with each other.
- At shut down, it **shuts down** the other components and invokes **cleanup methods** where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following five components:

- [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
- [**`Security`**](#security-component): **Validates** password presence and **handles** initial configuration.
- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command **executor** and **handler** for App Mode.
- [**`Model`**](#model-component): **Holds the data** of the App in memory.
- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): **Reads** data from, and **writes** data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user completes the initial password setup (e.g., submitting `"myPassword123"`).

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="900" />

Each of the five main components (also shown in the diagram above),

- defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
- implements its functionality using a **concrete** `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts such as `CommandBox`, `PersonListPanel`, `PersonDetailPanel`, `ResultHistory`, and `SetupPanel`.
These, including `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures **common behavior** among classes that represent visible GUI parts.

Spyglass uses **mode-aware UI behavior**:

- In **Locked mode**, the window title appears as **"AddressBook"** to preserve **plausible deniability**.
- In **Unlocked mode**, the window title appears as **"Spyglass"** and **private-only fields** (such as status details in `PersonDetailPanel`) are shown.
- On **first launch** (or **invalid password state**), `MainWindow` displays `SetupPanel` to **collect and save** the initial password before normal command flow.
- `ResultHistory` is used to display **command outcomes** and **history** in the main window.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFX UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

- **executes** user commands using the `Logic` component.
- **listens** for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
- **keeps a reference** to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
- **depends** on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Security component

**API** : [`Security.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/security/Security.java)

Here's a class diagram of the `Security` component:

<puml src="diagrams/SecurityClassDiagram.puml" width="300"/>

The `Security` component is responsible for the application's **integrity check** upon startup and handling **password authentication state**.

- **Integrity Check:** Verifies if the `password` field in the storage file is **present** and contains **valid characters** via `isAuthenticated()`.
- **Startup Logic:** Returns a boolean value indicating whether the application should **transition** to the initial Setup Panel.
- **Password Setup:** **Validates** the user's plain-text input using `PasswordUtil` and **delegates** to the `Logic` component to persist the password state in local storage.

Current security scope for password handling:
- Password input is plain text at entry time (setup field and `unlock PASSWORD` command input are not masked).
- The password is stored as plaintext in the local JSON data file (no hashing/encryption in current scope).
- This aligns with project assumptions that Spyglass is used in a secure local environment.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions during the startup phase, showing how the `Security` component determines the initial UI state.

<puml src="diagrams/SecurityStartupSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions during the startup integrity check" />

How the startup check works:
1. `MainWindow` asks `Security` if the app is configured via **`isAuthenticated()`** during its initialization phase (**`fillInnerParts()`**).
2. `Security` **queries** `Logic` (which in turn queries `Model`) for the stored password state.
3. Based on the result (valid password vs. empty/missing), `Security` **returns a boolean** back to `MainWindow`.
4. If the application is **not authenticated**, `MainWindow` then invokes **`handleSetup()`** to load the new `SetupPanel` for the user.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

The `Logic` component is responsible for:

- **receiving** raw command text from the UI
- **parsing** that text into concrete `Command` objects
- **enforcing** mode-based command availability via `CommandRegistry`
- **executing** commands against the current `Model` using a `CommandContext`
- **applying** requested mode transitions through `AppModeManager`
- **saving** the address book through `Storage` after each command that completes without throwing
- **returning** a `CommandResult` to the UI so that the UI can handle follow-up actions such as
  selecting a person, showing setup, or exiting the application

Here is a partial class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="650"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for
`execute("delete 1")`, assuming the provided index is valid.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions inside the Logic component for the delete command" />

How the `Logic` component works:

1. `LogicManager#execute(...)` **receives** the raw command text from the UI and **logs** it.
1. `LogicManager` **forwards** the raw text to `AddressBookParser`.
1. `AddressBookParser` trims the input, **splits** it into `commandWord` and `arguments` using
   `BASIC_COMMAND_FORMAT`, then **queries** the current `AppMode` through the `Supplier<AppMode>`
   provided by `LogicManager`.
1. `AddressBookParser` **delegates** mode-aware command routing to `CommandRegistry`.
1. `CommandRegistry` **checks** whether the command is registered and allowed in the current mode.
   If either check fails, it **throws** a generic unknown-command `ParseException`.
1. If the command requires structured argument parsing, `CommandRegistry` **delegates** to a concrete
   parser such as `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, `EditCommandParser`,
   `FindCommandParser`, `HelpCommandParser`, `ToggleCommandParser`, `UnlockCommandParser`,
   or `ViewCommandParser`.
1. Commands that **do not require** their own parser, such as `clear`, `list`, `lock`, `exit`,
   and `setup`, are **instantiated directly** by `CommandRegistry`.
1. After parsing, `LogicManager` **creates** a `CommandContext`, which packages the current `Model`
   and `AppMode` at execution time.
1. The parsed command **executes** using that `CommandContext`.
   This **avoids stale-state issues** where a command could be parsed under one mode but executed
   after the application has already transitioned to another.
1. The command **returns** a `CommandResult`.
   In addition to user-facing feedback, `CommandResult` can **request follow-up UI actions** such as
   selecting a person by index, opening the setup flow, exiting the application, or transitioning
   to a different `AppMode`.
1. If `CommandResult` requests a mode change, `LogicManager` **updates** `AppModeManager`
   and **refreshes** the filtered list in `Model` for the requested mode.
1. `LogicManager` **saves** the current address book through `Storage`.
   If saving fails, `AccessDeniedException` and `IOException` are wrapped and surfaced as
   `CommandException`.

Concrete command classes **encapsulate** feature-specific behaviour after parsing. For example,
`AddCommand`, `DeleteCommand`, `ToggleCommand`, and `ViewCommand` **obtain** the current `Model`
and `AppMode` from `CommandContext` before mutating or querying the filtered list.
Commands then use `CommandResult` to **communicate follow-up actions**:
`AddCommand`, `EditCommand`, and `ViewCommand` can request UI selection through `selectedIndex`,
`SetupCommand` uses `showSetup`, `ExitCommand` uses `exit`, and `LockCommand` /
`UnlockCommand` request mode changes through `requestedMode`.

The parser-related classes used by the `Logic` component are shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="700"/>

How the parsing support classes work:

- All concrete parsers **implement** the `Parser<T>` interface.
- `AddressBookParser` is intentionally lightweight: it **only performs the initial split** of raw user
  input before handing mode-aware routing to `CommandRegistry`.
- `CommandRegistry` **centralizes** command registration and authorization, which keeps parser selection
  logic and mode rules out of `AddressBookParser`.
- `ArgumentTokenizer`, `ArgumentMultimap`, `ParserUtil`, `CliSyntax`, and `Prefix` are **reused** by
  parsers that need structured argument extraction and validation.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

- **stores** the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
- **maintains two filtered views** over the same underlying contact list:
    - `filteredLockedPersons`: shows **only public** contacts.
    - `filteredUnlockedPersons`: shows the **full contact list**, including public and sensitive contacts.
- behaviorally, this means **Locked mode** exposes only public contacts, while **Unlocked mode** exposes the complete list of public and sensitive contacts.
- **exposes** a mode-aware `ObservableList<Person>` via `getFilteredPersonList(AppMode)` so the `UI` can **bind** to the currently active mode and **update automatically**.
- **stores** a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` object.
- **stores and provides access** to the application password in `AddressBook` (used by authentication and setup flows).
- **provides mode-aware mutating operations** such as `addPerson`, `deletePerson`, `clearPersons`, and `setPerson` through APIs that accept an `AppMode` parameter.
- is largely **data-centric**, but currently has a deliberate dependency on `AppMode` for mode-aware operations.

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

- **can save** both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and **read** them back into corresponding objects.
- **saves** the application's **access password** alongside the contact list within `JsonSerializableAddressBook` to ensure the security state **persists** across application launches.
- **preserves** the privacy status of each `Person` status (Public or Sensitive) during serialisation, enabling the Model to **correctly filter** the FilteredPersonList based on the active AppMode.
- **inherits** from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, allowing it to be treated as either interface depending on the required functionality.

The `Storage` component depends on the following classes in the `Model` component:

- **`ReadOnlyAddressBook` & `ReadOnlyUserPrefs`**: Used to retrieve **immutable snapshots** of the data for the saving process.
- **`Person`**: Required by `JsonAdaptedPerson` to **map** contact details and privacy levels from JSON format to domain objects.
- **`UserPrefs`**: Used to **store and retrieve** metadata such as GUI settings and the path to the data file.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Setup Password

The current setup feature allows users to **configure a secure password** for their application. Setting up a valid password is **mandatory** to ensure the privacy of the Unlocked mode. The setup mechanism **switches** the user interface to a dedicated view via `SetupPanel`.

The setup initialization is **facilitated** by `MainWindow`, `SecurityManager`, and `LogicManager`. It securely **delegates** the
exact UI state change back to the UI context.

When an operation dictates that the user is required to set a password, the system **invokes** the `MainWindow#handleSetup()` mechanism. This occurs in two primary ways:

1.  **Initial Launch** — `MainWindow#fillInnerParts()` checks upon startup via `SecurityManager#isAuthenticated()`. If **no valid password** exists in the save file (such as on the first launch/data corruption), it **prevents** normal rendering of `MainWindow`.
2.  **Setup Command** — While in **Unlocked mode**, the user deliberately enters the `setup` command.

When the `setup` command is executed, `LogicManager` generates an **empty** `SetupCommand`. It creates and returns a `CommandResult` object with its `showSetup` flag evaluated to `true`. Because `SetupCommand` **always** requests the setup flow, `MainWindow` calls `handleSetup()` after receiving the `CommandResult` and **switches** the active GUI root to the `SetupPanel`.

Once the user is on the `SetupPanel`, they submit a string password, and the UI **triggers** the `MainWindow#handlePasswordInput(String)` callback. `SecurityManager` **intercepts** this, **validates** it utilizing `PasswordUtil`, and **communicates** with `LogicManager` to store it via `LogicManager#setAddressBookPassword()` and writes it persistently via `LogicManager#saveAddressBook()`.

The following operations actively **facilitate** password setup and its view transitions:

* `SecurityManager#isAuthenticated()` — **Validates** whether a setup screen should appear.
* `CommandResult#isShowSetup()` — **Indicates** whether the current command requests the setup interface; for `SetupCommand`, this is always `true`.
* `MainWindow#handleSetup()` — **Triggers** the application into rendering its custom `SetupPanel` view.
* `SecurityManager#savePassword(String)` — **Validates** the password and **stores it persistently** in `Storage`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the system behaves at each step when initiated via command.

**Step 1.** The user launches the application, successfully enters the **Unlocked Mode**, and types `setup`.

**Step 2.** The `LogicManager` **propagates** execution. Since the command identifies correctly, the parser **creates** a `SetupCommand`.

**Step 3.** The `SetupCommand` **executes**. It **creates** a `CommandResult` instantiated with a `showSetup` flag set to `true`.

**Step 4.** The `MainWindow` **receives** the `CommandResult`, observes that `isShowSetup()` is `true` for `SetupCommand`, and **immediately calls** `MainWindow#handleSetup()`, which **renders** the secondary `SetupPanel` directly onto the primary stage.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the user fails to input a valid secure string inside the `SetupPanel`, `SecurityManager` **throws an exception** that `MainWindow` catches, ensuring the user stays **restricted** inside the `SetupPanel` until a valid one is stored.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an explicit `setup` execution passes through the UI and Logic component:

<puml src="diagrams/SetupSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Setup Sequence Diagram" />

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How a password entry executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** **Switches** to a dedicated `SetupPanel` view.
    * **Pros:** Prominently **guides** the user through the password setup and ensures the user is **not able to interact** with the application without going through the critical setup phase.
    * **Cons:** Architecture becomes **slightly more complex**, as the state transition requires propagating an abstract representation of UI intent (`showSetup=true` flags inside `CommandResult`) directly back to the active `MainWindow`.

* **Alternative 2:** **Execute it purely** as a one-liner console command like `setup mypassword123`.
    * **Pros:** Requires **almost no architectural additions** inside `UI`, very simple implementation, avoids an entire UI panel creation sequence.
    * **Cons:** Harder to implement **mode-based command restrictions** as the initial setup will need be executed in Locked mode but password changes should only be done in the Unlocked mode. Furthermore, the setup command could be **saved in the `CommandHistory`**, potentially revealing the existence of hidden functionalities in Locked mode.

### Lock/Unlock Mode Switching

This subsection describes how Spyglass switches between **Locked** and **Unlocked** mode.
It focuses on **mode transitions** and **UI behaviour** only.
Password setup and password persistence are documented separately.

The lock/unlock mechanism is facilitated primarily by `AppModeManager`, `CommandResult`,
`LogicManager`, `ModelManager`, and `MainWindow`.

Unlike an implementation that swaps between two separate databases, Spyglass keeps a **single
combined `AddressBook`** in memory and **exposes different views** of that data depending on the
current `AppMode`.

The relevant responsibilities are:

- `LockCommand#execute(CommandContext)` **returns** a `CommandResult` requesting `AppMode.LOCKED`.
- `UnlockCommand#execute(CommandContext)` **validates** the password against `Model` and **returns** a
  `CommandResult` requesting `AppMode.UNLOCKED` when validation succeeds.
- `LogicManager#execute(String)` **applies** the requested mode change through `AppModeManager`,
  **refreshes** the filtered list for the new mode, and **persists** the address book through `Storage`.
- `ModelManager#getFilteredPersonList(AppMode)` and
  `ModelManager#updateFilteredPersonList(Predicate<Person>, AppMode)` **expose the correct mode-based
  view** of the same underlying address book.
- `MainWindow#updateUi(AppMode)` **refreshes the visible UI** after a mode change by updating the
  application title, refreshing the person list, clearing the selected person details, and toggling
  restricted fields such as the status label in the detail panel.

The following state diagram summarizes the two application modes and their visible behaviour:

<puml src="diagrams/LockUnlockStateDiagram.puml" width="650" />

A few implementation details are worth noting:

- The current mode is **stored centrally** in `AppModeManager`.
- `LockCommand` and `UnlockCommand` **do not directly mutate** global application state.
  They only **return** a `CommandResult` that requests a mode transition.
- `LogicManager` is **responsible** for applying the mode transition and refreshing the filtered list.
- `ModelManager` **maintains two filtered views** over the same combined person list:
  one for locked mode and one for unlocked mode.
- While in locked mode, the contact list is filtered to **display only public contacts** with the `PersonStatus.PUBLIC` enum attribute.
  In unlocked mode, the filtered list can **show the full combined list**.
- A successful mode switch is **still followed by** `Storage#saveAddressBook(...)`,
  because `LogicManager` **persists** the address book after every command that completes without
  throwing an exception.

#### Lock flow

`lock` is registered **only for Unlocked mode** in `CommandRegistry`.
When the user executes `lock`, the command **does not directly update** `AppModeManager`.
Instead, it **returns** a `CommandResult` requesting `AppMode.LOCKED`.

`LogicManager` then:

1. **applies** the requested mode transition through `AppModeManager`
1. **refreshes** the model using `Model.PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS` for locked mode
1. **saves** the address book through `Storage`

After that, `MainWindow` **updates the visible interface** by:

- **changing** the window title from `Spyglass` to `AddressBook`
- **refreshing** the person list so only locked contacts remain visible
- **clearing** the currently selected person details
- **hiding** restricted UI fields such as the status label in the detail panel

The sequence diagram below shows the successful `lock` path:

<puml src="diagrams/LockSequenceDiagram.puml" width="900" />

One intentional UI decision is that lock success feedback is **not shown** in the result pane.
`MainWindow` **clears** the previous result history during a mode change, and **only restores** feedback
for unlock transitions.
This makes the locked interface appear **cleaner and less suspicious**.

#### Unlock flow

`unlock` is registered in **both modes**, but it behaves differently depending on the current state.

When the app is in locked mode, `UnlockCommand` **validates** the provided password against the value
stored in `Model`. If the password is correct, it **returns** a `CommandResult` requesting
`AppMode.UNLOCKED`.

`LogicManager` then:

1. **applies** the requested mode transition through `AppModeManager`
1. **refreshes** the filtered list for unlocked mode
1. **saves** the address book through `Storage`

Finally, `MainWindow` **updates the UI** by:

- **changing** the window title from `AddressBook` to `Spyglass`
- **refreshing** the person list so the unlocked-mode view is shown
- **clearing** the current person details and updating the detail panel for the new mode
- **showing** the unlock success message in the result pane

If the provided password is **incorrect** while the app is locked, `UnlockCommand` **throws** a generic
unknown-command `CommandException` instead of revealing password failure explicitly.
If `unlock` is executed while the app is **already unlocked**, it **throws** a specific
"already unlocked" message instead.

The sequence diagram below shows the successful unlock path and the incorrect-password path:

<puml src="diagrams/UnlockSequenceDiagram.puml" width="900" />

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: Where mode transitions should be applied**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Commands return a `CommandResult` that requests a mode change,
  and `LogicManager` applies the transition.
    - Pros: Keeps commands **simple** and avoids coupling them directly to global application state.
    - Pros: Ensures all mode-changing commands **follow the same post-processing pipeline**
      (mode update, filtered-list refresh, and save).
    - Cons: The full behaviour of `lock`/`unlock` is **split across** command, logic, model, and UI.

- **Alternative 2:** Let `LockCommand` and `UnlockCommand` directly mutate the current mode.
    - Pros: **Reduces** the amount of follow-up handling outside the command class.
    - Cons: **Increases coupling** between commands and application state managers.
    - Cons: Makes it **easier for commands to bypass** consistent refresh and persistence behaviour.

**Aspect: How locked and unlocked contact views should be represented**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Maintain **one combined address book** and expose **different
  filtered views** depending on `AppMode`.
    - Pros: Provides a **single source of truth** for all contacts.
    - Pros: **Simplifies features** that operate across both modes, such as toggling a contact's status.
    - Pros: **Avoids data duplication** and synchronization problems between separate lists.
    - Cons: Mode behaviour **depends on correct filtering logic** in `ModelManager`.

- **Alternative 2:** Maintain **separate data stores** or **separate in-memory lists** for locked and
  unlocked contacts.
    - Pros: Makes the distinction between the two modes **conceptually explicit**.
    - Cons: Introduces **extra synchronization complexity** when contacts move between modes.
    - Cons: Makes shared operations and persistence logic **harder to maintain**.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

- is a privacy-conscious user under high scrutiny in their domestic environment
- has a need to manage sensitive contacts discreetly and securely
- requires near-instant concealment of private data during unexpected checks
- can type fast and prefers typing to mouse interactions
- is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: Allows privacy-conscious users to manage sensitive social connections faster and more discreetly than a typical mouse/GUI driven app

### User stories

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance

1. The application should remain **responsive** during normal use and handle around **1000 contacts** without noticeable slowdown.
2. Common command-driven actions should complete **quickly enough** to feel immediate in day-to-day use.
3. The application should **start up within a few seconds** on typical desktop hardware.

#### Usability

1. A user who types reasonably fast should be able to complete most tasks **faster with commands** than with the mouse.
2. The interface should support **keyboard-only** workflows.
3. Error messages should be **clear and actionable**, unless a generic response is required to **preserve disguise/security** behavior.

#### Compatibility and Portability

1. The application should run on **mainstream operating systems** with Java `17` installed.
2. The application should be distributable as a **single JAR file** and use **portable JSON** data files.

#### Privacy and Security

1. In locked mode, the window title should **not reveal** Spyglass branding or other sensitive clues.
2. Restricted commands should **not leak** the hidden mode through visible UI feedback.
3. Contact data should remain **local to the device** and should **not depend** on network access.
4. Spyglass assumes operation on a trusted local environment (for example, a user-managed device already protected by OS-level access controls).
5. Password setup and unlock are designed for use only when the user judges the surrounding environment to be
safe from observation. Password input is not masked, and shoulder-surfing protection is not provided.
6. Stored data remains human-readable plaintext JSON, including the password. Data-file encryption is intentionally out of scope and not implemented, in line with the project constraints.

#### Reliability and Data Handling

1. The application should **preserve data** across restarts and **recover cleanly** from invalid or corrupted stored data.
2. Saved data should remain **human-readable** and be **validated** before it is loaded.

#### Accessibility

1. The interface should remain usable with **keyboard-only** navigation.
2. Text and controls should stay **readable** under standard UI scaling and contrast settings.

### Glossary

#### Design Personas
- **Privacy-conscious user**: An individual who maintains a distinction between sensitive and public contacts, requiring distinct access protocols and visibility levels for each to ensure personal privacy.
- **User under scrutiny**: A user in a high-pressure environment where their digital privacy is actively monitored or at risk of compromise.

#### Application States
- **Locked Mode**: The default, public state of the application. It functions as a standard, mundane address book to provide plausible deniability and hide the existence of any sensitive data from onlookers.
    - *Visual Identifier:* The window title displays as **"AddressBook"** to blend in with standard utility software.
- **Unlocked Mode**: The secure state of the application, revealed only after entering a hidden password. This mode allows the user to view, add and manage sensitive contacts that are otherwise hidden.
    - *Visual Identifier:* The window title displays as **"Spyglass"** to confirm the user has access to private data.

#### Contact and Command Types
- **Sensitive Contact**: A contact entry that is only visible and accessible while the application is in Unlocked Mode.
- **Public Contact**: A contact entry that remains visible in both Locked and Unlocked modes.
- **Highlighted Contact**: The specific contact entry currently selected from the list, whose full details are displayed in the UI component located at the bottom left of the interface.
- **Restricted Command**: A command that is only operational in a specific mode.
- **Unrestricted Command**: A command that functions consistently across both Locked and Unlocked modes.

#### Interface and Environment
- **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS.
- **API (Application Programming Interface)**: A set of rules or protocols that govern the application to allow different software components or external applications to communicate and work together.
- **CLI (Command Line Interface)**: A text-based interface where users interact with Spyglass by typing specific commands on a keyboard.
- **GUI (Graphical User Interface)**: The visual component of the application that displays contact lists and command results, allowing users to see information processed via the CLI.
- **JAR**: A Java Archive file format used to distribute the Spyglass application and its required libraries as a single, portable executable file.
- **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**: A lightweight, human-readable data format used by Spyglass to store contact information, password and application settings in local storage.

#### Use Case Terminology
- **MSS (Main Success Scenario)**: The most straightforward interaction for a given use case that assumes nothing goes wrong and all steps are completed successfully.
